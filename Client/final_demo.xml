         that the server must send a trigger for the event to either start or end. Setting the START_TRIGGER to
         AUTOMATIC means that the event will start automatically and that the XML expects a START tag. Setting
         the END_TRIGGER to AUTOMATIC means that the event will end automatically and that the XML expects an
         DELAY tag. The start and delay times are in seconds.
